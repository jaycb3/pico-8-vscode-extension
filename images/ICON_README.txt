ICON PLACEHOLDER

To complete the extension, you need to add an icon:

1. Create a 128x128 PNG image
2. Name it: icon.png
3. Place it in this folder (images/)

Icon suggestions:
- PICO-8 cartridge design
- Pixel art style (matches PICO-8 aesthetic)
- Simple, recognizable design
- Use PICO-8's 16-color palette!

Without an icon, the extension will still work, but won't look as polished in the marketplace or extensions panel.

You can create one with:
- PICO-8 itself (export as PNG)
- Any pixel art tool
- Online generators like favicon.io
- Photoshop/GIMP/etc.

Colors to use (PICO-8 palette):
#000000 (black)
#1D2B53 (dark blue)
#7E2553 (dark purple)
#008751 (dark green)
#AB5236 (brown)
#5F574F (dark gray)
#C2C3C7 (light gray)
#FFF1E8 (white)
#FF004D (red)
#FFA300 (orange)
#FFEC27 (yellow)
#00E436 (green)
#29ADFF (blue)
#83769C (indigo)
